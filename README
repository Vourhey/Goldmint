The contract is deployed at Kovan
Address: 0x55eA517A0e1bD69F85b6e324efD15dc9Da29e2E6

Steps:
1. Get IPFS hash (ipfs add <file>)
2. Convert it to hex (fromipfshash.js <ipfshash>)
3. Add new row to the smart-contract (hash, sum, weight)
4. Get ID from `lastID` field

If you want to get a row from the smart-contract, use getItem(ID)
To get IPFS hash, use toipfshash.js <hex>

It's possible to store IPFS hash as a string, but it's more expensive than constants-length hex
